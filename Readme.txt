----------------------------------

This is a simple program for controling Philips TV & DVD.
Program uses RC-6 mode 0 for sending so older TV's that use
RC5 will not work. 
Program has a test mode in which you can send any deviceID and 
command.

Thanks to PspPet for raw IR stuff.

Source code is included.

I take no responsibility for any damages or problems caused to
your PSP or other devices by the use of this program. 
Use at your own risk.
